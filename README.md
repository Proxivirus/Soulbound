# Potion Stacking

Equip your items with this enchantment so you don't lose them when you die!

All tools, weapons and armor supported, included modded items. On top of that, you can put Soulbound on other essentials like boats, minecarts, shulker boxes, beds, and more!

Items with durability will lose a percentage of it when returned to your inventory after a death. This value can be tweaked or even disabled in the included config.

This mod is a semi-port of [Souldbound Enchantment](https://modrinth.com/mod/soulbound-enchantment) by [iMoonDay](https://modrinth.com/user/iMoonDay) kind of unintentionally. I was originally going to make a different type of enchantment, but I ended up using so much code from their original mod to learn how to make enchantments, do configs, Mod Menu support, and set up datagen, I figured it would be pointless to not just port the rest of the code to newer versions as well. If I get time, I'll port the NeoForge version over as well.
